# Transfer-

This Project is part of ML for Image Processing course
We aim to predict a bird species given its picture. 
Dataset is Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB-200-2011) dataset and may be downloaded from
http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia-data/CUB-200-2011/CUB_200_2011.tgz.
We will use a small subset of this dataset with 20 bird species
having 743 training images and 372 images for validation.

We implement transfer learning using from a pretrained network: VGG
